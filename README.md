# Iris-Dataset-Analysis

The Iris dataset project involves the analysis and classification of the famous Iris flower dataset, which comprises measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different Iris flower species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. This dataset is commonly used as a benchmark in machine learning and statistics due to its simplicity and effectiveness in demonstrating classification techniques.

The project aims to explore and visualize the dataset to gain insights into the morphological differences among the three Iris species. Statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning algorithms are applied to classify Iris flowers accurately based on their features. The dataset is typically split into training and testing subsets for model development and validation.

Various machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and support vector machines can be employed to build classification models. The project evaluates and compares the performance of these models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Through this project, one can gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. It highlights the significance of understanding dataset characteristics and selecting appropriate algorithms to solve real-world classification problems.
